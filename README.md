🛢️ OilyGiant — Optimal Oil Well Location Prediction
📘 Overview
This project helps OilyGiant Mining Company identify the most profitable region for developing new oil wells.
Using geological data from three regions, a Linear Regression model predicts oil reserves, estimates potential profits, and evaluates investment risks using bootstrapping.

🚀 Project Steps
1. Data Preparation
	• Load and preprocess geological data for three regions:
		○ geo_data_0.csv
		○ geo_data_1.csv
		○ geo_data_2.csv
	• Each dataset contains:
		○ id — unique oil well identifier
		○ f0, f1, f2 — geological features
		○ product — actual oil reserve volume (thousand barrels)

2. Model Training
For each region:
	• Split the data into 75% training and 25% validation sets.
	• Train a Linear Regression model to predict oil reserves.
	• Evaluate model performance using RMSE and the average predicted reserve volume.

3. Profit Calculation
	• Budget: $100 million for 200 wells.
	• Revenue per thousand barrels: $4,500.
	• Select the top 200 wells with the highest predicted reserves.
	• Calculate the total profit for each region.

4. Risk Assessment
	• Apply Bootstrapping (1,000 samples) to estimate:
		○ Average profit
		○ 95% confidence interval
		○ Probability of loss (negative profit)
	• Only regions with a risk of loss < 2.5% are considered.
	• Choose the region with the highest mean profit and acceptable risk.

🛠️ Tools & Libraries
	• Python
	• Pandas
	• NumPy
	• Scikit-learn
	• Matplotlib
	• Seaborn

📈 Outcome
The project delivers a data-driven recommendation for selecting the optimal region to develop new oil wells — maximizing profitability while minimizing financial risk.

📁 Data
File	Description
geo_data_0.csv	Geological data for region 0
geo_data_1.csv	Geological data for region 1
geo_data_2.csv	Geological data for region 2
⚠️ All datasets are synthetic and provided for educational and analytical purposes.

🧮 Key Assumptions
	• Only Linear Regression is used for predictions.
	• Each exploration studies 500 points, and the best 200 are developed.
	• Development budget: $100 million.
	• Revenue per unit (thousand barrels): $4,500.

📊 Results
	• Predicted oil reserves and RMSE per region.
	• Estimated profits with confidence intervals.
	• Final recommendation for the most profitable, lowest-risk region.

🏁 Conclusion
This analysis enables OilyGiant to make a data-informed investment decision, identifying the region with the highest expected profit and minimal financial risk.
